"# Clothing-Shop-Inventory-Management-System"

This C-based project is a simple console application that manages an inventory system for a shopping mall. The system allows users to view shops and their available clothing items, view detailed information about each item, and add new items and shops.

Features

View Shop Details: Provides detailed information on a selected shop, including its phone number and items available.
View Clothing Items: Lists all available clothing items across the shops with details like item name, size, code, manufacture year, and price.
Add New Clothing: Users can add new clothing items and associate them with an existing or new shop. Each item includes attributes like size, code, manufacture year, and price in a specified currency.

How to Use
Run the application, and a main menu will display options to Visit Shop, Add Clothing, or Exit.
Select Visit Shop to see a list of shops and their inventory.
Choose Add Clothing to enter details for a new item, including its size, shop, and price.
Select Exit to close the application.

Structure
